# GISS-Temperature-Predictions
The following is an assignment that I completed in an advanced Earth Systems quantitative analysis course (ESYS 300) at McGill University. 

I looked at the predictability of Global Mean Surface Temperatures. I used the mean surface temperature anomaly of the first 3 months of the year as a predictor for the full year mean surface temperature anomaly (9 month lead time). 

Next, I repeated this process, but used the temperature anomaly in the Equatorial Pacific (El Nino region) from the previous year to predict the following year global mean temperature anomaly (1 year lead time). 

My results show the thermal inertia of the oceanâ€™s surface.
